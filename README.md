Once on the game website, use the first textbox to choose a game mode. To do so, type either (without quotation marks):  
"1" (to learn keys and their locations)  
"2" (to test your knowledge by typing out words and phrases)  
"3" (to type out full sentences with no hints)  

In the second textbox, you will input the letters, words, phrases, or sentences read aloud, followed by the enter key. You may change the mode you are playing at any time by editing the number in the first textbox.
