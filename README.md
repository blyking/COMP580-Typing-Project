Once on the game website, use the first textbox to choose a game mode. To do so, type either (without quotation marks):  

"1" (to learn keys and their locations)  

"2" (to test your knowledge by typing out words and phrases)  

"3" (to type out full sentences with no hints)

"4" (for a further brief description of game)

In the second textbox, you will input the letters, words, phrases, or sentences read aloud, followed by the enter key. You may change the mode you are playing at any time by editing the number in the first textbox.

This game is designed to help visually impaired students learn how to type and spell.


If an educator, parent, or student would like to inject their own words, phrases, or sentences into the game, here are the steps needed to do so:

1. Download the entire repo into a folder on your computer
2. Open Intro.js in a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code
3. Add, edit, or replace any of the following:
        
        i.  Words: line 78 (var words = [...])
        
        ii. Phrases: line 79 (var phrases = [...])
        
        iii. Sentences: line 91 (var sentences = [...])
4. Save the .js file and close the editor
5. Open the index.html file in a browser (Preferably Google Chrome)
